# To Do List Express
 ![](todo.png)
# Made with:
####  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js,Express Mongodb.
# Lesson Learned:
####
I used Node.js with Express as the framework. I was able to use CRUD get,post,put and delete requests. I learned how to connect a Mongodb database and store data. I was able to display that data with EJS HTML. Comparing this to my previous To Do List I enjoyed this method more!
